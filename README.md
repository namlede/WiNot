This was the PennApps Spring 2014 project of [JacobEdelman](https://github.com/JacobEdelman), [kullalok](https://github.com/kullalok), and [namlede](https://github.com/namlede).

From the [ChallengePost Page](https://challengepost.com/software/winot):

> Even in today's connected world, there are times when an Wi-Fi connection is simply not available: in a car, on (most) planes, in the middle of the desert, and at PennApps. Why shouldn't we be able to connect to the Internet all the time? Indeed, WiNot! WiNot is a Chrome Extension that brings you your favorite parts of the webâ€”even when you have no Internet connection. WiNot looks through your browsing history and downloads static versions of pages that you accessed in the past, and pages that are linked to by those pages. Then, when WiNot's redirecting functionality is enabled and you try to access a webpage, you are redirected to the latest version of that page that is stored on your computer. With easy-to-use settings and a minimalist interface, WiNot lets you be productive.
